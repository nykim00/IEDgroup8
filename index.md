## Team Charter
<br/> 

### Goals
Successful completion of this semester project.
Making good grades for each other by helping them prepare for exams, etc.
 
### Rules
Don't cut in the middle of what the other person says.
Leave a confirmation message in the middle of the project.
Don't speak in a strong tone when you have a different opinion from the other person.
Take care not to talk to team members without being able to control your own emotions.
Converse with honorifics as the project progresses.
Be sure to turn on the camera during the Zoom conference.
 
### Resource limits
It can only be missed once when we all decide to get together.
As four people gather, the time to meet is limited, so don't spend a maximum of 10 hours per person a week.

## Problem Statement
<br/> 

_**"Discontinuation of group face-to-face treatment"**_

<br/> 
<br/> 

-------------------------

##  Principal Functions
<br/> 

+ There should be no deterioration of the disease.
+ Must be able to meet the majority.
+ There should be no virus propagation to external.

<br/> 
<br/> 

-------------------------

##  Metrics
<br/> 

**Survey**
 * STAI_X1 test to measure state anxiety
 * EQ-5D-5L test to measure the degree of life satisfaction and motivation for mentally ill people
  
<br/> 
<br/> 

-------------------------

## Limits or Boundaries
<br/> 

**Objectives**
 - Everyone should be safe from viruses.
 - The effect of counseling treatment should be on patients.
 - As a group it should be efficient in your time and money.

**Constraints**
 - At least eight to a maximum of 11 people are needed for group face-to-face treatment
 - A space must provide a distance of at least 2m each for 8 people

## Design Alternatives
<br/> 

![Design 1](https://github.com/nykim00/IEDgroup8/blob/gh-pages/Design1.PNG?raw=true)
 
**advantage**
 - Since the space between the infected patient and the non-infected person is separated, there is little possibility that the virus will be exposed to the outside.

**disadvantage**
 - Because the counselor and the patient are in separate spaces based on windows, communication between them may not be smooth.
 - Since patients are in independent NPU, it may be difficult to immediately prevent sudden behavior of the patient.
<br/>
<br/> 

![Design 2](https://github.com/nykim00/IEDgroup8/blob/gh-pages/Design2.PNG?raw=true)

**advantage**
 - Face-to-face treatment conducted in an outdoor area gives patients a boost to their lives during frustrating isolation.
 - Patient protector can join the treatment process.

**disadvantage**
 - It can be affected by sudden climate change because it proceeds outside.
 - As it is outdoors, the scope of sudden action.
<br/>
<br/> 

![Design 3](https://github.com/nykim00/IEDgroup8/blob/gh-pages/Design3.PNG?raw=true)
 
**advantage**
 - Because counselors and patients are in the same space(unit), communication is smooth.
 - The counselor can immediately recognize the patient's condition and supplement next treatment.

**disadvantage**
 - Because the counselor has to wear protective clothing, she is less active and puts a strain on her body.
 - Sudden behavior among patients can occur because patients meet face to face. 
 - Since it is a virus prevention that consists only of acrylic plates and masks in NPU, there is a high risk of spreading the virus to counselors. 
<br/> 

![Design 4](https://github.com/nykim00/IEDgroup8/blob/gh-pages/Design4.PNG?raw=true)

**advantage**
 - Since the space between the infected patient and the non-infected person is separated, there is little possibility that the virus will be exposed to the outside.
 - Patients are less likely to spread another disease because they have private units.
 - Because each patient has an independent space, it can prevent injury to other patients due to sudden behavior of mental patients. 
 - The treatment room is designed in a circular shape, allowing patients to see each other's appearance completely, and counselors can better check the patient's condition by looking at all the patients as a whole.

**disadvantage**
 - Because there are many spaces that are abandoned in design, efficiency is low.
<br/> 
<br/> 

![Design 5](https://github.com/nykim00/IEDgroup8/blob/gh-pages/Design5.PNG?raw=true)

**advantage**
 - The treatment room is designed in a circular shape, allowing patients to see each other's appearance completely, and counselors can better check the patient's condition by looking at all the patients as a whole.
 - During treatment, the homogeneity among patients can be improved as patients stay close to each other.

**disadvantage**
 - There is a high possibility of transmission of the virus between patients and between patients and counselors because the movements are bound to overlap.
 - It is difficult to recognize each other's facial expressions between the counseling parties.
 - In some cases, the counselor turns against the patient.
<br/> 
<br/> 

![Design 6](https://github.com/nykim00/IEDgroup8/blob/gh-pages/Design6.PNG?raw=true)

**advantage**
 - Counselors are less likely to be exposed to the infectious virus.
 - Space utilization is high for group face-to-face treatment in hospitals.
 - Because each patient has an independent space, it can prevent injury to other patients due to sudden behavior of mental patients. 
 - Patients are less likely to spread another disease because they have private units.


**disadvantage**
 - Patients may not be able to hear well from counselors and other patients because they conduct group face-to-face counseling in a closed single unit.
 - There may be sound problems or equipment damage.

## Design Description and Specifications
<br/> 

![Choosen Design](https://github.com/nykim00/IEDgroup8/blob/gh-pages/Choosen%20Design.PNG?raw=true)

This is our final design.

1. There are a digeut(ㄷ)-shaped corridor and a digeut(ㄷ)-shaped hospital room of a 3-2-3 formation and the space between them is the counselor's space.
2. The door from each hospital room is toward the corridor and each hospital room is facing the counselor's space.
3.Window-size glass is installed between the NPUs.
4. On the wall facing the counselor's space, full glass is installed with above the adult waist level.
5. Blackout curtains is installed on the glass facing the counselor's space in each NPU.
6. Microphone is installed on the wall and built-in speaker  is on the ceiling.
7. Counselor's space is connected with NS.

<br/> 
<br/> 

-------------------------

## Proof of Concept
<br/> 

Experiment with how far people feel when people meet online or behind glass walls at a certain distance.
