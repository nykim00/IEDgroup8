### Goals
Successful completion of this semester project.
Making good grades for each other by helping them prepare for exams, etc.
 
### Rules
Don't cut in the middle of what the other person says.
Leave a confirmation message in the middle of the project.
Don't speak in a strong tone when you have a different opinion from the other person.
Take care not to talk to team members without being able to control your own emotions.
Converse with honorifics as the project progresses.
Be sure to turn on the camera during the Zoom conference.
 
### Resource limits
It can only be missed once when we all decide to get together.
As four people gather, the time to meet is limited, so don't spend a maximum of 10 hours per person a week.
